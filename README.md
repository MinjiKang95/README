### Train your own model

* GPU machin : mlwyberns.sogang.ac.kr

* 컨테이너 생성/실행
   사용된 이미지 - musing_darwin_backup
   ```
   nvidia-docker run -i -t --name [컨테이너 이름] musing_darwin_backup /bin/bash
   ```
* 데이터 파일 놓을 위치
    ```
    /root/tf-faster-rcnn/data
    ```

1. Download pre-trained models and weights. 

   For Resnet101, you can set up like:
   ```Shell
   mkdir -p data/imagenet_weights
   cd data/imagenet_weights
   wget -v http://download.tensorflow.org/models/resnet_v1_101_2016_08_28.tar.gz
   tar -xzvf resnet_v1_101_2016_08_28.tar.gz
   mv resnet_v1_101.ckpt res101.ckpt
   cd ../..
   ```

2. Train (and test, evaluation)
  ```Shell
  ./experiments/scripts/train_faster_rcnn.sh [GPU_ID] [DATASET] [NET]
  # GPU_ID is the GPU you want to test on
  # NET in {vgg16, res50, res101, res152} is the network arch to use
  # DATASET {pascal_voc, pascal_voc_0712, coco} is defined in train_faster_rcnn.sh
  # Examples:
  ./experiments/scripts/train_faster_rcnn.sh 1 pascal_voc res101
  ```
  **Note**: Please double check you have deleted soft link to the pre-trained models before training. If you find NaNs during training, please refer to [Issue 86](https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn/issues/86). Also if you want to have multi-gpu support, check out [Issue 121](https://github.com/endernewton/tf-faster-rcnn/issues/121).

3. Visualization with Tensorboard
  ```Shell
  tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard/vgg16/voc_2007_trainval/ --port=7001 &
  tensorboard --logdir=tensorboard/vgg16/coco_2014_train+coco_2014_valminusminival/ --port=7002 &
  ```

4. Test and evaluate
  ```Shell
  ./experiments/scripts/test_faster_rcnn.sh [GPU_ID] [DATASET] [NET]
  # GPU_ID is the GPU you want to test on
  # NET in {vgg16, res50, res101, res152} is the network arch to use
  # DATASET {pascal_voc, pascal_voc_0712, coco} is defined in test_faster_rcnn.sh
  # Examples:
  ./experiments/scripts/test_faster_rcnn.sh 0 pascal_voc vgg16
  ./experiments/scripts/test_faster_rcnn.sh 1 coco res101
  ```

5. You can use ``tools/reval.sh`` for re-evaluation


By default, trained networks are saved under:

```
output/[NET]/[DATASET]/default/
```

Test outputs are saved under:

```
output/[NET]/[DATASET]/default/[SNAPSHOT]/
```

Tensorboard information for train and validation is saved under:

```
tensorboard/[NET]/[DATASET]/default/
tensorboard/[NET]/[DATASET]/default_val/
```

The default number of training iterations is kept the same to the original faster RCNN for VOC 2007, however I find it is beneficial to train longer (see [report](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02138.pdf) for COCO), probably due to the fact that the image batch size is one. For VOC 07+12 we switch to a 80k/110k schedule following [R-FCN](https://github.com/daijifeng001/R-FCN). Also note that due to the nondeterministic nature of the current implementation, the performance can vary a bit, but in general it should be within ~1% of the reported numbers for VOC, and ~0.2% of the reported numbers for COCO. Suggestions/Contributions are welcome.
